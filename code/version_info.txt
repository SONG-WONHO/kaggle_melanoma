v0: Default
    - Base

v1: Sampler
    - BalanceBatchSampler: sample class to be stratified in batch level (Good)
    - BalanceSampler: upsample or downsample (Bad)
    - Sampler is bad when use cosine scehudler

v2: Custom loss
    - Weighted Loss Function (weighted to melanoma) (Bad)

v3: Best Metric vs Best Loss
    - From best metric to best Loss: Don`t know well
    - Need to change loss functions

v4: Scheduler
    - CosineWarmUp (Good)

v5: Stochastic Weight Averaging
    - Done (Good, Need to experiment)

v6: Transform Test
    - v5, Add SWA option (Good, Need to experiment)
    - WIP

v7: Train from scratch
    - More and more (WIP)

v8: Change Target
    - BinaryClassification to MultiLabelClassification
    - Need more experiment, lb isn`t aligned to cv scores.

v9: Sub Target
    - Sub Target 1: diagnosis (Good)
    - Sub Target 2: anatom_site_general_challenge + diagnosis (Good or Bad, overfitting)
    - Must check dependency with meta features.
    - sub target 2 lead to overfit, so there are needs for limitation of overfitting.

v10: Aux Target
    - Base model: Multitask model (binary target + sub target 1)
    - Aux target: anatom_site_general_challenge (overfitting)
    - Must check dependency with meta features.


To Do
    - Label Smoothing
    - Focal Loss
    - Dropout & Weight Decay in Optimizer
    - Cutmix or mixup to 0 label, if good extend to sub targets
